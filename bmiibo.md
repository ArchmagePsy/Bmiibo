# Bmiibo Buto Chess
## A meme I took too far
Bmiibo Buto Chess is a play on words of "amiibo" and "auto chess" in a moment of 
genius/idiocy I was like: "I could totally make SSB amiibo fighters" but "amiibo" 
is already taken, so I summoned up all my intelligence, creativity, and wit to 
create my own new original brand.

## What the fuck is a Bmiibo?
A Bmiibo is a virtual fighter in a text-based auto-battler game that I created, it uses an
algorithm known as Q-learning to learn how to play the game but here's the kicker, each one
is customizable. A Bmiibo's attack's and abilities can be customized using JSON or through
the help of my handy bot, Judy (short for Adjudicator). This customization of fighters adds
depth to the game as it's meta changes based on the people who are playing it, currently 
there are 9 "actionTypes" in the game (more will be added) which may not sound like a lot but
the properties of these actions can be edited and multiple actions can be sequenced in different
ways.

## The Game
### The Board
The game is played on an NxN board (the values of N are normally 4, 8, 16) and each player's 
Bmiibo is placed on a random cell (the algorithm actually does its best to space them out 
on the board but a large number of players on a small board can result in closer starting
positions).

### Play
At the start of a match the order of the players is shuffled and one by one a Bmiibo takes
1 action then passes it's turn to the next. Play ends when only one Bmiibo is left.

#### But how is a Bmiibo removed?
That's easy, death. A Bmiibo begins each match with 100 hitpoints and when it is reduced to 0
it is considered "dead" (more on this later).

#### What actions can a Bmiibo take?
There are 4 actions: moving, attacking, ability, and ultimate. Moving can be done every turn
but attacks, abilities, and ultimates all have cooldowns though a cooldown of 1 means it can be
performed every turn. All actions that involve a cooldown are "ticked" at the start of the turn
but cannot be "overticked." A Bmiibo must take an action on its turn but it is entirely possible 
for a Bmiibo to take an action that does not properly resolve e.g if it makes a ranged attack 
targeting a square that doesen't have an enemy in it the action will still be used up but will 
do nothing. the difference between attacks and abilities/ultimates is that attacks *must*
target an enemy whereas abilities/ultimates can target any cell. The only thing that 
distinguishes ultimates from abilities is that the balance-formula (discussed later) allows
them to do more damage/healing etc. than a regular ability.

### Customizing
The files for your Bmiibos actions should be named in the format `{bmiibo name}_{attack|ultimate|ability}.json`
and a Bmiibo requires one of each to work. For example here is a simple attack.
```json
{
  "actionType": "melee",
  "element": "normal",
  "amount": 10,
  "cooldown": 1
}
``` 
The `actionType` tells us what type of action to trigger here, `cooldown` is how long we have to wait
before we can use this attack again, `amount` is how much damage this melee action should do,
and lastly `element` is the type of damage which potentially causes the damage dealt to be 
doubled if the target has a weakness to it.

#### An aside on elements
The elements available are "normal", "fire", "water", "earth", "air", "light", and "dark"
using a particular element is often just by preference.

### Customizing (cont.)
It is also possible to define an action group if you want your action to do more than one thing.
```json
[{
  "actionType": "melee",
  "element": "normal",
  "amount": 10,
  "cooldown": 1
},
{
  "actionType": "heal",
  "amount": 10,
  "selfTargeting": 1
}]
``` 
The actions are executed in the order they appear in the `[]` and the `cooldown` of the first 
action is used for the entire group. Since the first action is the same as before I will only
explain the second one. `actionType` tells us that this part should execute the heal action,
`amount` tells us how much we should heal the target by, `selfTargeting` has a value of 1 (meaning true)
and tells us that this action should target the userâ€”this is important because this is an action for an 
attack so if set to 0 it would heal our enemy whereas with `selfTargeting` set to 1 we will damage our enemy
and heal ourselves. 

### Current actionTypes
Here is a list of all the actionTypes available at this point. The basic parameters that every action
must have are: `actionType` and `cooldown`

#### melee
The parameters for this are: `element` and `amount`. Does damage to an adjacent bmiibo equal to `amount` and of type `element`.

#### heal
The parameters for this are: `selfTargeting` and `amount`. Restores `amount` health up to 100 and can auto target the user if
`selftargeting` is 1, if 0 targets the chosen cell.

#### ranged
The parameters for this are: `element` and `amount`. Does damage to a non-adjacent bmiibo equal to `amount` and of type `element`.

#### blockade
The parameter for this is: `blocks`. Creates an impassable (Blocked cell) adjacent to the user, up to `blocks` blocks can be
present at any one time, when this amount is exceeded the block placed first is removed.

#### weakness
The parameters for this are: `element`, `selfTargeting`, `remove`. Adds or removes weakness to an `element` depending on whether
or not `remove` is equal to 0 or 1 and targets a specific cell or the user depending on whether `selfTargeting` is 0 or 1.

#### explosion
The parameters for this are: `amount`, `radius`, `force`, `element`. Deals an `amount` of `element` damage to enemies in an area centered
on the target cell with the specified `radius` pushing them back an amount equal to `force` from the centre. If an enemy
cannot be pushed the entire distance away they do not move at all, additionally the target cell must be a distance greater than
`radius`+1 away from the user.

#### whirl
The parameters for this are: `element`, `amount`, `force`. Melee damage of `amount` and `element` is dealt to all adjacent enemies 
who are each pushed away from the user by an amount `force`. Like explosion if they cannot move the full distance they are not moved at all.

#### piercing
The parameters for this are: `element`, `amount`. Does damage of `amount` and `element` to all enemies in the direction of target
provided the target is horizontally or vertically inline with the user.

#### charge
The parameters for this are: `element`, `amount`, `recoil`, `distance`. Moves `distance` times towards the target and if it
lands on an adjacent cell it does melee damage of `amount` and `element` but deals damage to the user of `recoil` and `element`
regardless. `recoil` must be a non-zero number.

### Caveats in death
Death is actually slightly more complex than I eluded to earlier, in actuality when a bmiibo drops to 0 hp it does not "die"
until the start of its next turn meaning that it remains within the realm of possibility for an enemy bmiibo to to heal a dying
bmiibo if it thinks this will be beneficial, additionally over damaging a bmiibo is also possible because of this though such
actions are quite rare.
